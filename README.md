From Wikipedia:

Kavidi, the shell of “Money cowry” or “Cypraea moneta” has many roles in the culture and life of Keralites, thanks to the Arabian Sea that marks the western border of Kerala.

Kavadikali is an Indian board game, played during the era of kings. This game was used to improve eye-to-eye coordination, and to teach teenagers war tactics and strategy. It also helps in developing counting skills.

The movement of coins is controlled by throw of 4 or 6 cowry shells. Ashta Chamma is primarily a game of chance, but involves thinking and planning. It is an interesting and amusing way to develop strategy skills. Instead of cowries, dice can also be used.

This game is divided for Juniors and Seniors. The Junior board consists of 5x5 grid with 5 crossed boxes and the Senior board consist of 7x7 grid with 8 crossed boxes. [more...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashta_Chamma_(board_game))
