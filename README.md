# KavidiKali

From Wikipedia:

Kavidi, the shell of “Money cowry” or “Cypraea moneta” has many roles in the culture and life of Keralites, thanks to the Arabian Sea that marks the western border of Kerala.


Kali means “Game” or “Play” in Malayalam. Kavidi-Kali is “Money cowry shell-game”. KavidiKali is one of the interesting uses of “Kavidi”; the other significant use being predicting one’s future with his/her horoscope.


I am no future teller, so to me, Kavidi is something to play with, and we used to play KavidiKali a lot. But that was when I was a child, and today I sure am missing those days.

So when I had the opportunity to do something I love to, Kavidikali flash game was one of the natural choices, and indeed I enjoyed doing it.


KavidiKali is played in different ways in different parts of Kerala, I(sooraj.p) implemented the version I(sooraj.p) learned from my father's native place "Ayyanthole", a suburb of Thrissur.
