        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kavidi, the shell of "Money cowry" or "Cypraea moneta" has many roles in the culture and
        life of Keralites, thanks to the Arabian Sea that marks the western border of Kerala.

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kali means "Game" or "Play" in Malayalam. Kavidi-Kali is "Money cowry shell-game".
        KavidiKali is one of the interesting uses of "Kavidi"; the other significant use being predicting one's future
        with his/her horoscope.

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement of coins is controlled by throw of 4 or 6 cowry shells, hence it is a game
        of chance. KavidiKali is primarily a game of chance, but involves thinking and planning. It also helps in
        developing counting skills. It is
        an interesting and amusing way to develop strategy skills. Instead of cowries, dice can also be used.
